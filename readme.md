#CS330 Portfolio

1)
I approach designing software in a methodical and logical approach.  This means identifying the needs the software needs to address on paper, drawing out pseudocode diagrams to 
understand what feautres need to connect to each other, and then begin coding.  This project has added computational grpahics in OpenGL to my skills list.  This will offer me new 
approaches to grpahical programming and design in my applications.  In the case of this project I followed a pretty similar approach as normal.  I identified the core image, 
determined what objects needed to be created, determined what shapes comprised the objects, performed mathemtical measurements and conversions, and began applying to the code 
aspect.  I feel as though the tactics I took here can be utilized going forward.  The necesarry steps I took to convert real world measurements to the flaots became critial to get 
scale correctly.  This foray will only be more useful in the future.  Likewise, my planning procedures and learning how to make my code in such a way that it is malleable and able 
to extrapolate specific data easily when you need to make big changes or retart will be highly beneficial. 

2)
Developing programs follows a simlar approach.  The need to identify the needs to address and determine the functionality on a working level still hold the same as we would have 
figured in design.  While design should be focused on layout, UI, and the ideas of what features need to exist and talk to each other, development should be taking those items and 
making them practical.  As such this may mean looking at a feature thats needed and determineing what types of functions need to exist in it to make it run properly.  In the scene 
I utilized new strategies like modular programming to help achieve the end game. Iteration was used to create repeteitive instances of objects.  For example, a table leg was 
needed so it was programmed. The table requires four legs to be logical, so I program the positions of each leg in array and then tell the draw function to iterate over a loop 
through the array positions.  This allows multiple instances of the same object without a needed to code every instances of the object.  My approach would have evolved from 
creating very simple fucntions and features of a program to createing a highly complex one that incorporates multiple classes and calls on other classes and cpp files to perform 
functions instead of doing everything in one go.

3)
Computer Science can help me in my goals since my current goals are linked to it.  At present my goal is to develop programs and applications in a professional environment.  
Computer Science is necesarry so I can get the skills I need to do so.  Computational Grpahics will be useful in my educational pathway as it helps me get a much stronger grasp on 
C++, taught me how to create graphics in a computer program, and how to use OpenGL.  These skills will become ever more useful as I continue my education and progress through 
classes that will draw upon these skills and knowledge.  In my professional pathway, computational graphics will be an important skill.  There are few circumstances where a script 
app will work for the client.  In most cases they want a UI which needs to look nice. Computational Graphics can help me develop stunning grpahics and images for those 
applications. Further pratcice of these skills and becoming signficantly better at them may help me stand out amongst other candidates in the job hunt.
